# Student Performance Dahboard Project using Excel
## In this project, I have cleaned and analyzed a dataset consisting of students' scores in various subjects. I have created additional columns such as 'Average Score' and 'Grade' for better analysis. After this, I created an Excel dashboard that displays various insights from the dataset.

## The dashboard provides an overview of the dataset, showcasing the average score by gender and test preparation by lunch. It also presents the grades earned by students based on their ethnicity and parental level of education. Additionally, I have included key performance indicators (KPIs) for total, male, and female students.

## To make the dashboard more user-friendly, I have incorporated filters for gender, ethnicity, and grade. With these filters, users can easily view specific insights they are interested in.

## Overall, this project highlights my data cleaning, analysis, and dashboard creation skills. I hope you enjoy exploring the dashboard and gaining insights from the data!
